# SudokuSolver

After self-learning the Sudoku algorithm over the summer through online readings and research, I developed my version of a simple Sudoku Solver in Python. This solver uses back-propagation, rather than randomized guesses, to speed up the solving process. 

In my code, I have included 3 examples of Sudoku boards I found online, to test my board.
